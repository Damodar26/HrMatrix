# HRMatrix

HRMatrix is an application developed using Flutter and Firebase, aimed for providing organizations and companies with a platform to manage and analyze performance of the employees and staff members working in that organization. Designed for a smoother and efficient connection between the admin and the employees, the app focuses on faster responses, regular updates, leave requests and performance based analysis of every employee.

Key Features:
1.Restricted Access
•	Every employee is individually provided with a unique email address which can only be accessed by them.
•	This email provided is different for the admin and the employees working under him/her, as the admin can access the information of every employee.

2.Attendance Record
•	Attendance of every employee is recorded with check-in and check-out time which is updated as on marked. Total days present and absent for work is also recorded with a detailed view accessible to the admin.

3.Analysis and Performance Overview
•	A detailed analysis of the attendance record, monthly performance and task completion status is calculated and represented graphically.

4.Leave Requests
•	Employees can request for leaves by providing detailed dates and reasoning. 
•	These requests are further accepted or rejected by the admin or the head in charge. Status of leave request is then depicted and consequently updated.

5.Regular Updates
•	Employees can be notified with regular updates and meetings scheduled.
•	These updates are sent by the admin or the head of department for the employees to be on track.
